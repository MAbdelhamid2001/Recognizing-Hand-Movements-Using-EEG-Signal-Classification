Methodology :
3 different feature extraction techniques
  1. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
  2. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)
  3. Extracting statistical features

* we used different machine learning methods such as LDA, Random forest, and SVM.
Also, we used deep learning methods such as CNN, LSTM, and EEGNET architecture.
