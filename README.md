# Recognizing-Hand-Movements-Using-EEG-Signal-Classification
Using the following system architecture we managed to classify 6 different hand movements  (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, UP, Dawn)
for both the real movement and the imagery movement (Motor imagery)

* system architecture:

Methodology :

we used 3 different feature extraction techniques
  1. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
  2. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)
  3. Extracting statistical features

* we used different machine learning methods such as LDA, Random forest, and SVM.
Also, we used deep learning methods such as CNN, LSTM, and EEGNET architecture.

* Deployment
  we used Unity and Blender for creating a simulator for the movements
