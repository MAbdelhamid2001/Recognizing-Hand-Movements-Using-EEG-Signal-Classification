# Recognizing-Hand-Movements-Using-EEG-Signal-Classification
Using the following system architecture we managed to classify 6 different hand movements  (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, UP, Dawn)
for both the real movement and the imagery movement (Motor imagery)

* Methodology :

  we used 3 different feature extraction techniques
    1. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
    2. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)
    3. Extracting statistical features

* we used different machine learning methods such as LDA, Random forest, and SVM.
Also, we used deep learning methods such as CNN, LSTM, and EEGNET architecture.

* Results
  
  * The following Bar chart shows our results when classifying 6 movements for different subjects (`blue`) in comparison with the original Paper (`orange`)

* Deployment
  
  we used Unity and Blender for creating a simulator for the movements
